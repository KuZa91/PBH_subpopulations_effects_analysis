## Introduction ##

In this repository, we give all the notebooks required in order to perform the analysis described in [Article to appear](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YKCp3LuI-r3vTaaQufVOETpI-CM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/google-404-error-0f9029ad5ea14b2db1cddb65d8188f69.png).
The analysis is based on the results obtained in [S.Babak et al.](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2651157) and [S.S.Bavera et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05836), and will require to run the notebook and scripts presented in [Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue](https://github.com/KuZa91/Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue).  
The motivation for this study is to understand the effects of possible _Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)_ sub-populations over the fiducial _Black Holes (BHs)_ population observed by the _LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ([LVK](https://www.ligo.org/))_ collaboration, when the next generation of _Gravitational Wave (GW)_ detectors (such as [LISA](https://www.elisascience.org/) and [ET](https://www.einsteintelescope.nl/en/)) will run.
The fiducial _BH_ population is taken in agreement with what is presented in the latest _LVK_ [inference paper]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03634)), and the results are extended at higher redshifts using the approach described in [S.Babak et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/08/034). The _PBH_ sub-populations will instead be generated with a _merger rate_ in agreement with what is presented either in [S.S.Bavera et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05836) or [V. Atal et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12218), in particular, the _PBH_ abundance in $R(z = 0)$ will be set as a fraction of the _LVK_ fiducial population abundance.
We are going to test sub-population having a mass function that follows either a _Log-Normal_ distribution (as in [S.S.Bavera et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05836)) or a _Gaussian_ distribution (see [V. Atal et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12218)).

## Analysis details ##

Details of the analysis can be found in our [Article to appear](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YKCp3LuI-r3vTaaQufVOETpI-CM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/google-404-error-0f9029ad5ea14b2db1cddb65d8188f69.png).

## Additional material ##

In order to reproduce the results of our paper, an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) environment with _python 3.x_ is needed.
This analysis, was performed using _python 3.8_. In order to estimate the _SNR_ for the generated events, some supplementary materials and libraries are needed.
In particular :

- The notebooks and SNR estimation scripts require the installation of [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org/). This library can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) with the command:
```sh
pip install pycbc
```
- The SNR estimation scripts will need the sensitivity curves of the chosen detector in order to run, these files will be available in this directory for the [ALIGO](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/ALigoSens.txt), [A+LIGO](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/AplusDesign.txt) and [ET](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/ETSens.txt) designs.

- Some function will require a _C_, _C++_ compiler in order to run, the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler may be easily installed by running : 

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

- A copy of the notebooks developed in [Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue](https://github.com/KuZa91/Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue/tree/master) is required in order to generate the catalogs of the population. We recommend using the latest version which allows to generate _PBH_ sub-populations catalogs and be found in the linked [BH-SynthesisNotebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue/blob/master/BHCatalogV8.0.ipynb).

## How to run the PBH-subpopulation analysis ##

The steps required in order to reproduce the results presented in [Article to appear](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YKCp3LuI-r3vTaaQufVOETpI-CM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/google-404-error-0f9029ad5ea14b2db1cddb65d8188f69.png) are as follows:

1. Use the [BH-SynthesisNotebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/Generating-a-BH-Merging-Catalogue/blob/master/BHCatalogV8.0.ipynb) to generate $\sim 10$ _LVK_ fiducial population catalogs. The catalogs are constructed in the source frame, and need to be converted into the detector frame for the analysis using the script [to_DetFrameV3.py](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/to_DetFrameV3.py). After converting them, the _SNR_ of the events on the various detectors can be generated by means of [IMRPhenomXHM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06503) waveforms using the [XHM-SNR Script](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/AddIMRPhenomXHMAnalSNR.py);

2. The analytical _SGWB_ for the fiducial population can be generated using the [AnalyticalSGWB-Notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/AnalyticSGWB.ipynb), this is based on the code presented in the [SGWB_Directory](https://github.com/KuZa91/Constructing-an-Analytic-SGWB). The notebook will present the results both graphically (see [SGWBPicture](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/SGWB%26Sensitivity_curves.png)) and numerically. The value of the SGWB-amplitude reported will be needed in order to perform the next step!

3. The $\sigma_\alpha$ value of the fiducial _SGWB_ amplitude can be estimated by running the [FisherMatrixSGWB-Notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/FisherMatrixSGWB.ipynb). The results will be presented both graphically (see [ConfidenceEllipsesFigure](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/ConfidenceEllipses.png)) and numerically, the latters will be needed as an input for the next step !

4. We can finally run the [SGWBPSAnalysis-Notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/PBH_subpopulations_effects_analysis/blob/main/SGWBPSAnalv2.1.ipynb) to generate the datasets required to compute the main plots of [Article to appear](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YKCp3LuI-r3vTaaQufVOETpI-CM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/google-404-error-0f9029ad5ea14b2db1cddb65d8188f69.png), the setups for the notebook are described in the latter. On first run


## Additional information about the execution of the notebooks

- On first run

  <code> Compute_SNRMat = True </code> 

  in <code>In[11]</code> 
  
- Depending on how old your strain data is, it may be saved either with the acronym _LOSC_ or _GWOSC_, differences in the data sets may results in errors while trying to load the data, so always double check that the name of the files are matching. In particular, the strain arrays inside the data files would have their channel named differently according to what stated at the [GWOSC](https://www.gw-openscience.org/o2_details/), to solve the channel name problem one simply need to replace the '_LOSC-STRAIN_' string passed in <code> In[5] </code> and <code> In[7] </code> at [CreateResiduals.ipynb](https://github.com/gwastro/gw150914_investigation/blob/master/CreateResiduals.ipynb) using '<em>GWOSC-4KHZ_R1_STRAIN</em>'.

- The strain data of event [GW151226](https://github.com/GravWaves-IMF/Correlation-Method-first-2019-/tree/master/Code/GW151226) has got _NAN_ values at the start, this will result in numerical errors during the _PSD_ estimation, in particular, you would notice that from a _NAN_ result from <code> Out[20] </code> of [CreateResiduals.ipynb](https://github.com/gwastro/gw150914_investigation/blob/master/CreateResiduals.ipynb). To avoid problems one simply need to add the two labels <code> start_time=psd_start_time-pad_data,
                                     end_time=psd_end_time+pad_data </code> when running reading commands like <code> In[7] </code> in  [CreateResiduals.ipynb](https://github.com/gwastro/gw150914_investigation/blob/master/CreateResiduals.ipynb).
                                     
- If you wish to reproduce the multiple subplots, as done for [AllMaxCorrVsTimeShift.png](https://github.com/GravWaves-IMF/Correlation-Method-first-2019-/blob/master/Code/AllMaxCorrVsTimeShift.png) and [AllBackgrounds.png](https://github.com/GravWaves-IMF/Correlation-Method-first-2019-/blob/master/Code/AllBackgrounds.png), a guide on how to generate multiple subplots may be found in the [Jake VanderPlas D.S Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.08-multiple-subplots.html)
